        "answer": "Our team is happy only when our customer is happy, and your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed by our customer success team. If your edited images aren't up to your standards, or if we've misunderstood your needs, contact us through the form on our site. We'll do whatever it takes to make sure your final image files are according to your requirements. If you're still not happy and would like a refund, we're happy to refund you. Be sure that you keep the following conditions in mind...All modifications and refund requests must be made within 7 days of the initial order fulfillment. If the edited images follow the same quality standard as an approved sample image, we cannot refund that order. We do understand that sometimes things change outside of our control, so we may be able to adjust the edits to meet your needs at a reduced cost. If you've downloaded all of your edited images and are unable to provide a valid reason for dissatisfaction, no refund is applicable. We got a few statistics over the years that show First Time Approval 99.5%, On-Time Delivery 99.8% and Customer Satisfaction 99.99%. Pretty amazing!"
