        "answer": "You can choose from the following turnaround times... 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours. 24 hours is the default turnaround time, but you can change this when you customize and confirm your order. The longer the turnaround time, the less the image-editing services will cost. If you're working against a tight deadline, you can also pay extra to have your images back in less than 24 hours. Some of the turnaround times may not be available for your project. This is because of various factors, such as our total workload, which services you need, and how many images are in your order. The amount of the discount or additional cost for different turnaround times may vary from project to project. T his also depends on the factors listed above."
